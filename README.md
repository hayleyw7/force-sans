# Light Reader

**Light Reader** is a Chrome browser extension designed to analyze web pages. Light Reader will generate a light mode that aims to improve **web accessibility** as the only public light mode extension that forces a light theme (black text on white background). It also applies sans serif font (Tahoma) by default for additional inclusivity.

## Purpose

### Light Mode

Dark text on a light background, also known as light, day, or positive polarity modes, has been shown to increase legibility, reduce eye strain, and improve memorability. [Sources and research here.](https://github.com/hayleyw7/documentation/purpose/theme.md)

### Tahoma Font

Sans serif fonts, which lack decorative elements, are often preferred in digital content due to their higher legibility, especially for people with visual disabilities. [Sources and researched here.](https://github.com/hayleyw7/documentation/purpose/font.md)
