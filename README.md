# Force Sans

**Force Sans** is a Chrome browser extension designed to improve accessibility of the web. It makes all font Tahoma and minimize font size 16px.

## Why Tahoma?

Sans serif fonts, which lack decorative elements, are often preferred in digital content due to their higher legibility, especially for people with visual disabilities. [Sources and researched here.](https://github.com/hayleyw7/documentation/purpose/font.md)
