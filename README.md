# Light Reader

Light Reader is an **open-source** [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/hayleyw7/lightreader/blob/main/LICENSE) **browser extension** designed to analyze web pages. Light Reader will generate a light mode that aims to improve **web accessibility** for the majority of users by **reducing eyestrain** and **improving text readibility** by forcing light theme and sans serif text by default.
